### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juana

:female_detective: I am a journalist and I currently work at the Digital Narratives Team at <a href=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/autor/juana-copello-13450/ target="_blank">LA NACION</a>, a national newspaper in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

:iphone:	Iâ€™m interested in how different types of media, design and technology come together with communications and journalism to create not only new ways of telling stories but also a value-added product for readers and audiences.

:woman_technologist: I am a hobby developer and I am now learning p5.js and d3.js, hoping to apply my knpwledge for creative coding and data visualization.
