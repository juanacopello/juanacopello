### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Juana

:female_detective: I am a Journalist and I currently work at LA NACION in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

:woman_technologist: Iâ€™m interested in how Media, Design and Technology come together with journalism to create not only new ways of telling stories but also a value-added product for readers and audiences.

:technologist:	I am currently learning to code: I have intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am now learning with p5.js and hope to begin coding with d3.js soon.

:paintbrush:	I am also interested in UX/UI Design, hoping to apply these skills to news applications and information design.
