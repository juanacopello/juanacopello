### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juana Copello. I am a Journalist and I currently work at LA NACION in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I am interested in how Media, Design and Technology work together to create the perfect product.

I am currently learning to code: I have basic and intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can see the different projects I have worked on. I am now starting to learn React.js

I am also learning about UX/UI Design, hoping to apply my knowledge to News Applications.
