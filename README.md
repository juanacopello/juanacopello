### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juana Copello.

:female_detective: I am a Journalist and I currently work at LA NACION in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

:woman_technologist: Iâ€™m interested in how Media, Design and Technology come together with journalism to generate a value-added product or article for readers.

:technologist:	I am currently learning to code: I have basic and intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can see the different projects I have worked on. I am now starting to learn React.js

:paintbrush:	I am also learning about UX/UI Design, hoping to apply my knowledge to News Applications.
