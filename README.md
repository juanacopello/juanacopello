### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juana

:female_detective: I am a journalist and I currently work at the Digital Narratives Team at <a href=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/autor/juana-copello-13450/ target="_blank">LA NACION</a>, a national newspaper in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

:iphone:	Iâ€™m interested in how different types of media, design and technology come together with communications and journalism to create not only new ways of telling stories but also a value-added product for readers and audiences.

:woman_technologist: I am currently learning to code: I have intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am now learning p5.js and hope to begin with d3.js and vue.js soon.

:artist: I am also interested in UX/UI Design, hoping to apply these skills to news applications and information design.
